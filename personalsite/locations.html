                Now, to get to what you're actually here for. The park! Some travelers enjoy the hikes, and some enjoy just driving around to the 
              prettiest locations the park has to offer. Whichever your preference, this website will have a spot for you. We will provide you 
              with shorter trails to backpacking trails. We will let you know which spots are best for photo ops and which might be best to take a 
              family with young children. We will let you know where wildlife is known to sighted, and what times you might want to come out with 
              a camera to capture them in their natural environment. We want you to enjoy your time at these famous parks as much as possible!
