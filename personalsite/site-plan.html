          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <h3>Purpose</h3>
          <p>I will provide lodging and excursion information for the top 5 National Parks in the United States. The top five will be Glacier National Park, 
            Grand Canyon National Park, Yellowstone National Park, Yosemite National Park, and Zion National Park. The intended audience would be new National Parks
            who are looking to get into a new hobby.

          <h3>Audience</h3>
          <p>[Welcome to the National Parks Travel Planner. This website was created to be a guide to new National Parks travelers who are looking to make the most 
            out of their experiences with the smallest amount of research possible. This website will serve you as a basic how-to guide for traveling to the top 3 parks 
            in the United States of America. These top 3 parks are Glacier National Park, Grand Canyon National Park, and Yellowstone National Park. These are some of 
            the highest rated and most traveled parks. I have personally been to each of them, and will be able to provide you both basic and insider guidance to each. 
            Each park will have the following information provided: Lodging (Camping, RVs, Cabins and/or Hotels), Locations (hikes, sightseeing), 
            and Maps (containing ranger stations, bathrooms, etc.).

              Lodging is one of the most important parts of planning a trip. Without a place to stay, enjoying your time somewhere becomes a 
              lot more difficult. I have not personally been to all of the lodgings recommended, but I have personally researched every single 
              one of the sites to make sure you will have the best time possible. Whether you prefer camping or glamping, 
              or you plan to bring an RV, there will be a location for you. There are three cheaper options, three mid-priced options, 
              and three more expensive options. There will also be a variety for larger groups and smaller groups.] <!-- change this -->

              Now, to get to what you're actually here for. The park! Some travelers enjoy the hikes, and some enjoy just driving around to the 
              prettiest locations the park has to offer. Whichever your preference, this website will have a spot for you. We will provide you 
              with shorter trails to backpacking trails. We will let you know which spots are best for photo ops and which might be best to take a 
              family with young children. We will let you know where wildlife is known to sighted, and what times you might want to come out with 
              a camera to capture them in their natural environment. We want you to enjoy your time at these famous parks as much as possible!]  <!-- change this -->

              Without maps, you might have a hard time finding your way around the beautiful scenery. Our website will provide you with interactive maps 
              of each park as well as printable maps for when you might run into an area with no wifi. We will also provide maps of the trails we recommend 
              when we can so your chances of getting lost will be greatly reduced. 

              There are no activities on the site other than looking at the provided information. No prior information should be necessary, it should be self-explanatory 
              once you are on the site's homepage. How to click a button and how to scroll on a computer should be the max amount of knowledge needed. 
              We hope to provide you with a website that is user-friendly to all ages, and that makes its purpose clear. With this tool, you will be able to select 
              the best lodging and tourist locations to suit your needs. Not only that, but you can narrow down your search for vacations. Instead of individually researching 
              multiple parks on your own, browsing the internet for hours, you can use our comprehensive guide of the most traveled parks to find what's right for you. 
              Whether you prefer cold or warmer weather, camping or air-conditioned buildings, hiking or driving, our website has the park for you. You can book your vacation 
              quicker and easier with the help of the National Parks Travel Planner. Get ready for your new adventure today!] <!-- changes this -->
