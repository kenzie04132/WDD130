    <p>Hello! I'm Kenzie Ash, I'm 20, and I'm majoring in Computer Science. I'm from a small town near Dallas, Texas.
       I have 3 younger siblings, one who is going on his mission in a couple of months. I enjoy hiking and camping,
       as well as videogames and watching movies with friends. 

       I only have a little experience with programming. I was in a robotics program before college, and I have
       taken a few classes covering programming at BYUI.  </p>
